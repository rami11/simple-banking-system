## Simple Banking System

### About
Everything goes digital these days, and so does money. Today, most people have credit cards, which save us time, energy and nerves. From not having to carry a wallet full of cash to consumer protection, cards make our lives easier in many ways. In this project, you find a simple banking system with database.

### How it works
Just add a database file name of your choice as an argument before you run the program.

You can set these attributes in intelliJ
Main class:       _com.rsn.bankingsystem.Main_
Program argument: _-fileName <db_name.db>_

or run the command ```_java com.rsn.bankingsystem.Main -fileName <db_name.db>_```
